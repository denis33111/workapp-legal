# Work App Terms of Use

_Last updated: December 19, 2024_

These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern access to and use of the Work App platform, including the Flutter mobile applications, lightweight admin console, full-featured web console, related APIs, and any documentation or services provided under the Work App brand (collectively, the "Service"). By creating an account, installing the mobile app, or accessing the web console you agree to be bound by these Terms on behalf of yourself or the entity you represent. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

## 1. Eligibility and Accounts
- You must be at least 18 years old (or the minimum age required by local labor laws, but not less than 16) and authorized by your employer or contracting company to use the Service. Workers must provide date of birth during registration for age verification.
- Account creation is role-based: workers may request registration, the managing team approves or restricts access, and company representatives receive credentials through the admin console.
- You are responsible for safeguarding login credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account. Notify the managing team immediately of any unauthorized use.

## 2. Platform Scope
- The Service provides workforce management tools such as registration workflows, scheduling, attendance, chat, document compliance, finance tracking, analytics, and AI-assisted automation.
- Mobile features are tailored to worker, managing-team, or company roles, while the web console is limited to authorized managing-team personnel (owner, admin, supervisor, logistics, etc.).
- The unified TabManager and content generator system must be used for all tab-based features; attempts to bypass or manipulate the navigation layer are prohibited.

## 3. Acceptable Use
- Use the Service only for lawful business purposes related to workforce operations authorized by your employer.
- Do not interfere with, disable, or circumvent security, auditing, or memory-management safeguards, including offline storage synchronization, schedule services, or AI automation guardrails.
- Do not upload malicious code, harass other users, attempt to gain unauthorized data access, or misrepresent information (e.g., falsifying check-ins, check-outs, document submissions, or providing false personal information).
- Do not upload inappropriate, illegal, or copyrighted content through chat file attachments or document uploads. You are responsible for ensuring you have the right to upload any content you submit.
- Respect company policies governing chat, media uploads, location sharing, and document retention.
- You must provide accurate personal information including name, date of birth, address, emergency contact information, and all required documents. Providing false information may result in account termination.

## 4. Data Accuracy and Responsibilities
- Workers must ensure all personal data (name, date of birth, address, emergency contact, phone, email), attendance data, location data, document data, and profile photos submitted through the mobile app are accurate and current.
- Workers are responsible for taking their own profile photos (selfies) with face detection during registration. Profile photos must be current and accurately represent the worker.
- Workers are responsible for taking check-in and check-out photos when required by company policy. These photos must accurately represent the worker at the time of check-in/check-out.
- Managing-team users are responsible for verifying applications, schedule assignments, salary actions, document verifications, and compliance decisions before approving them in the web console.
- The Service provides AI-driven insights (smart scheduling, predictive alerts, automated reporting) but final operational decisions remain with human supervisors. You agree not to rely solely on automated suggestions.

## 5. Offline and Device Requirements
- The mobile app relies on device sensors (GPS for location tracking, camera for photo capture and face detection, notifications for alerts) and local storage (Hive/SQLite) to deliver offline-first functionality. You consent to these capabilities when enabled by your organization.
- The app uses face detection technology (Google ML Kit) to verify photos contain a face. This requires camera access and is performed locally on your device. No biometric templates are stored.
- Users must keep devices updated, maintain reasonable security (screen lock, OS patches), and allow the app to sync when connectivity is restored.
- You are responsible for ensuring your device has adequate storage space for offline data caching and photo storage.

## 6. Third-Party Services
- The Service integrates with Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Cloud Messaging) and may invoke external AI/ML providers for automation. Use of the Service constitutes acceptance of those providers' standard terms to the extent they apply.
- We are not responsible for third-party network failures, device issues, or integration outages.

## 7. Intellectual Property
- All software, documentation, design systems, source code, and trademarks associated with Work App are owned by the project maintainers or their licensors. No rights are granted except the limited license required to operate the Service.
- Feedback, suggestions, or improvements submitted by users may be implemented without obligation to provide attribution or compensation.

## 8. Confidentiality
- Schedule data, company documents, financial information, chat content (including file attachments), worker photos, attendance records, location data, and analytics accessible through the Service are confidential. You must not disclose or export this information outside approved business workflows.
- Chat messages and file attachments shared through the Service are confidential and intended only for authorized participants. Do not forward, screenshot, or share chat content outside the Service without authorization.
- If you receive data in error, you must notify the managing team and delete the information immediately.

## 9. Suspension and Termination
- Access may be suspended or revoked at any time for policy violations, inactivity, or at the request of the contracting company.
- Workers who lose approved status (restricted, suspended, or terminated) will no longer be able to sign in to the mobile app; cached data will be removed upon next sync.
- Upon termination, your right to use the Service ends immediately and you must uninstall the mobile app and cease all access to the web console.

## 10. Disclaimers
- The Service is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, including fitness for a particular purpose, uninterrupted availability, or accuracy of AI-generated insights.
- We do not guarantee compliance with labor laws, payroll regulations, or industry-specific mandates; the managing organization must configure workflows to meet legal obligations.

## 11. Limitation of Liability
- To the maximum extent permitted by law, the project maintainers and their affiliates will not be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising from use of the Service.
- Aggregate liability for direct damages will not exceed the amounts (if any) paid for access to the Service in the preceding twelve months.

## 12. Changes to the Terms
- We may update these Terms to reflect new functionality, legal requirements, or operational adjustments. Material changes will be communicated through the web console or admin notifications.
- Continued use after the effective date of updated Terms constitutes acceptance of the changes.

## 13. Governing Law and Disputes
- Unless superseded by a written contract with your organization, these Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the managing company is incorporated, excluding conflict-of-law principles.
- Any disputes will be resolved through negotiation, and if unresolved, submitted to binding arbitration or competent courts in that jurisdiction.

## 14. Contact
Questions about these Terms should be directed to the managing organization's designated administrator or the Work App project team at support@workapp.example.
- Note: The contact email address above is a placeholder and will be updated with the actual contact information prior to production deployment.

## 15. Service Availability
- The Service is provided on an "as available" and "as is" basis. We do not guarantee uninterrupted, error-free, or secure access to the Service at all times.
- The Service may be temporarily unavailable due to maintenance, updates, system failures, or circumstances beyond our control. We will make reasonable efforts to provide advance notice of planned maintenance windows through admin notifications or release notes, but are not obligated to do so.
- We do not provide service level agreements (SLAs) or uptime guarantees. Users are responsible for maintaining backup copies of critical data and should not rely solely on the Service for data storage or business continuity.
- We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Service at any time, with or without notice, though we will make reasonable efforts to minimize disruption to active users.

## 16. Payment Terms
- The Service is provided free of charge. There are no fees, subscriptions, or payment processing required to access or use the Service.
- No billing, invoicing, or payment collection mechanisms are currently implemented. All features and functionality are available without cost.
- If we introduce paid features, subscriptions, or premium tiers in the future, we will provide at least 30 days' advance notice through the Service interface, email, or admin notifications. Continued use of free features will remain available at no charge.
- This section does not create any obligation for us to maintain free access indefinitely, but any changes to pricing will be communicated in accordance with Section 12 (Changes to the Terms).

## 17. Indemnification
- You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Work App project maintainers, their affiliates, licensors, and service providers from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from:
  - Your violation of these Terms or any applicable law or regulation.
  - Your misuse of the Service, including unauthorized access, data breaches caused by your negligence, or failure to safeguard credentials.
  - Your infringement of any intellectual property, privacy, or other rights of third parties.
  - Content you submit, upload, or transmit through the Service.
- This indemnification obligation will survive termination of your access to the Service and these Terms.

## 18. Force Majeure
- Neither party will be liable for any failure or delay in performance under these Terms due to circumstances beyond their reasonable control, including but not limited to: natural disasters, pandemics, acts of war or terrorism, government actions, labor strikes, internet or telecommunications failures, or other force majeure events.
- If a force majeure event occurs, the affected party will notify the other party as soon as reasonably practicable and will use reasonable efforts to resume performance. Obligations will be suspended for the duration of the force majeure event.
- If a force majeure event continues for more than 30 days, either party may terminate access to the Service upon written notice, and any obligations will be discharged to the extent prevented by the force majeure event.

## 19. Severability
- If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid, legal, and enforceable, or if modification is not possible, it will be severed from these Terms.
- The invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability of any provision will not affect the validity, legality, or enforceability of the remaining provisions of these Terms.
- The remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect, and the invalid provision will be replaced with a valid provision that most closely reflects the intent of the original provision.

## 20. Assignment
- You may not assign, transfer, or delegate your rights or obligations under these Terms to any third party without our prior written consent. Any attempted assignment without consent will be void.
- We may assign, transfer, or delegate our rights and obligations under these Terms to any affiliate, successor, or acquirer in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, with or without notice to you.
- These Terms will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and assigns.
